            <p>For this project I customized the existing code for a personal profile page website. I added my own graphics, which inculded a background header image that I purchased from Shutterstock and a professional personal profile image of myself. I customized the webiste by adding my own textual content. I added my own links to GitHub, Twitter and LinkedIn accounts to the existing social networking links for the social networking svg's. I added new pages for experience, interests and contact. I customized those pages with my own textual content, HTML and CSS. I fulfilled the "exceeds expectations" requirements by adjusting the profile image border, transiton and transformation properties and by adding my own custom form on the contact page and by adding an extra image on the interests page.</p>

            </ul>

            </ul>
            
            <p>Add more photos and imagery to the page.</p>

            <p>Add more text to the page such as a list of your hobbies.</p>
