                    <p>For this project I customized the existing code for a personal profile page website. I added my own graphics. I added my own links to social networking icons. I added new pages and I customized all of the pages of the website with my own textual content, HTML and CSS.</p>

                    <p>For this project I created all of the HTML & CSS from scratch. I used a Google font for all of the text of the website. For this design I used a mobile-first approach where I designed the mobile view of this project as the basis for the base CSS. I then added media query breakpoints at 768px and 1024px and styled those breakpoints respectively. I linked the navigation menu to the correct sections of the page.</p>

                    <p>For this project I implemented Sass. I converted the provided CSS into Sass. I created different component partials that grouped together the major sections of the site. I created variables and mixins partials. I used Scout-App to watch the Sass directories for changes and then automatically imported those changes to their respective Sass files. I created color variables. I created a variable to be used for all media queries.</p>

                    <p>For this project I was supplied with the HTML and base CSS. I created all of the JavaScript code from scratch. The idea of this project was to create a letter guessing game that has the user guess the letters in a quote or phrase. The user gets five tries to guess the correct letters, if the user misses a letter one of the tries is lost. If the user guesses all the letters in the quote or phrase then a green overlay is displayed with a text message saying "You Won" and a button that says "Play Again". If the user loses the game by losing all 5 tries then a red overlay is displayed with a text message saying "You Lost" and a button that says "Play Again". The "Play Again" button for both turnouts resets and reloads the game. This project required the use of arrays, functions, event listeners, loops and conditional statements.</p>

                    <p>For this project I created all of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from scratch. I used Grid Layout and Flexbox to layout and arrange all the different sections of the web page. I used mobile-first responsive web design. I used a Google font for all of the text of the website. I used JavaScript to create an alert for tasks. I implemented charts using charts.js. I used SVG's to implement the social networking icons in their respective cards. I edited SVG parameters to change the fill of each social networking icon. I implemented message sending functionality for the messaging section. For the settings section I created custom toggle switches from a w3schools example. I used local storage. This project used JavaScript arrays, objects, functions, loops and conditionals. I implemented a JavaScript widget called "Awesomplete".</p>
